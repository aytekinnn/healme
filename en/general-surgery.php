                        <h3>Which Diseases do General Surgery Specialists Treat?</h3>


                        <p>Thanks to the progressed technological developments today, there are no big cuts and long healing periods after operations today. There are two main operation methods which general surgery experts perform as open and closed surgery (laparoscopic surgery). In open surgery, surgeon makes wide incisions (cuts) to see the relevant organs, tissues, vessels and nerves. In closed surgery, laparoscopic and robotic minimal invasive methods (which do not necessitate big cuts) are used. Application of the operation method depends on the existing situation of disease. General surgery specialists take charge in the treatment of following diseases:

                                            <p>Cancer occurs as a result of mutations in the genes which regulate cell growth. Formed mutations cause an uncontrollable growth and multiplying of cells. Uncontrolled breast cancer may metastasize (spread) into the healthy breast tissue and lymph glands in armpit.

                                                <li><b> Mammogram: </b> It is the best radiological screening method to see breast tissue and parenchymal structures and it is safe because its dose of radiation is so low. There is no pre mammography preparation needed but the cosmetic products like cream or lotion are to be avoided to make sure the device is screening correctly. A woman with silicone implant in her breast can have mammography but then the images obtained need to be evaluated with ultrasound. </li>

                                            <p>Stomach cancer is a disease which proceeds secretly and diagnosed in an advanced stage when noticed. Because its symptoms can be also of other diseases, they are underestimated by patients. One of the most important reasons of this disease is a bacterium called Helicobacter Pylori. During the gastroscopy which is made within diagnosis, the disease is detected as a result of the pathological examination by taking samples from suspicious areas. Screening techniques like tomography, MR and PET are benefited from to determine its scope and option of treatment. With surgery, there are also chemotherapy and radiotherapy to be used in treatment. Surgery is the first option in suitable patients. In surgery, all of stomach and lymph nodes around it are taken.

It is an insidious type of cancer whose symptoms are not seen in the beginning. A feeling of uneasiness on the higher part of stomach and loss of appetite are observed. Blood tests, PET scanning, ultrasounding, and MR are the most illustrious diagnosis methods. If it is diagnosed before spreading into other areas and situation of patient is suitable, surgery is the first treatment method. <br>

                                            <p>It is quite a significant cancer type because it causes death mostly and it is diagnosed in a million of persons every year. There is no frequency special to women or men. Beginning of colorectal cancers is growth of cells which we call as polypus. The more these polypuses begin to become cancerous, the more they cause complaints like:
                                                • Constipation and defecation changes like diarrhea <br>
                                                • Anaemia <br>
                                                • Blood in excreta <br>
                                                • Stomach-aches, loss of appetite and weight <br><br>
                                                Methods like: <br><br>
                                                • Pathological examination of the samples taken while colonoscopy <br>
                                                • Blood tests <br>
                                                • Disguised blood examination in excreta <br>
                                                • CAT tomography, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance (MR), PET scanning used in diagnosis. <br><br>
                                                Surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the most frequently used treatment methods. Laparoscopic and robotic attempts are successfully practiced in surgical treatment. <br>
                                                Chemotherapy and some target specific drugs are used in suitable cases.

                            <h5>Thyroidal Diseases </h5>
                            <p>All or part (lobectomy) of the thyroid is taken in the operation called as thyroidectomy. Thyroid gland may need to be taken by operation in diseases like thyroid cancer, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism and thyrocele. If any spread happens into the tissues in other areas, lymph glands in neck are also taken out. <br><br>
                                Before thyroidectomy, physician examines the disease area diligently with ultrasound and determines method of operation. Patient is taken after at least eight hours of hunger and necessary blood tests are made. If there are some complications like hoarseness and sore throat, this retreats after operation in a short time period. Because the organ is taken and thyroidal hormones cannot be produced after thyroidectomy, physician applies hormonal replacement treatment. Patients have to take these medications until the end of their life.

                            </p>

                            <h5>For which conditions is the radioactive iodine therapy (RAI) suitable?</h5>
                            <p>Patient can take radioactive iodine therapy before or after operation. Cancerous tissues are quite small in the patients who should take RAI before medication and surgeon may predict that the disease can retreat by RAI. If any cure cannot be provided with RAI, patient has thyroidectomy operation. RAI treatment is also applied in order to prevent multiplying of cancerous cells and provide a full cure after the operation.

                                            <p>If you are encountered with the following situations you may have information from your doctor: <br><br>
                                                • Body Mass index of 40 or more <br>

                                                Bariatric surgery is not suitable for every morbid obese patient. Psychological situation and medical examination of patient are important in decision of operation.

                                                All types of bariatric surgery have risks. However, physician determines the most suitable method with a physical examination and blood tests. The most common bariatric surgery types with most successful results in our country are:

                                                <center>
                                                    <h4 style="color: #34afe4;"> Gastric By-Pass </h4>
                                                </center>
                                                This method which has no return has been practiced successfully in our country. Surgeon cuts the upper part of stomach and fixes the middle part of small intestines in walnut size onto this area to prevent leakage. In this way, food passes into the middle part of small intestines directly after the small stomach. Operation risk is low and eating capacity after operation decreases significantly.

                                                <center>
                                                    <h4 style="color: #34afe4;"> Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch</h4>
                                                </center>

                                                This is similar to sleeve gastrectomy but has two stages. 80 % of stomach is taken. Then, skipping a large part of intestines, the edge part of intestines is fixed into the nearest duodenum to stomach. Patient is enabled to lose weight by eating less. Disadvantage of this method is vitamin and mineral deficiency caused by malnutrition. <br><br>
                                                Patient psychology is so important after bariatric surgeries and patients must take medical help. There can be over eating attacks or no eating at all by taking the problems during operation into consideration and anorexia nervosa may be encountered. For the continuation of weight loss and getting rid of many health problems after bariatric surgery, patients should take care of their diet and change their life styles.
