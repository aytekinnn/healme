						<!-- <h3>Kanser Hastalığı İçin Türk Kliniklerde Uygulanan Güncel Tedavi Yöntemleri</h3> -->
						<p>Cancer is a fatal health problem but significant developments in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancer are obtained with the methods which are up to date and intense work of our doctors. </p>
						<p>Cancer cells multiply uncontrollably and form abnormal formations with destroying the normal graft of body. <br> <br>
							Because cancer is the second most common reason of death, early diagnosis and treatment is quite important. Thanks to the innovative diagnosis methods and experience of our physicians, successful developments have occurred regarding cancer scanning and treatment, and the survival rate of our patients has increased. <br><br>
							Cancer cells grow uncontrollably and spread many parts of the body (metastasis). Cancer cells may be everywhere in the body which consists of trillions of cells. Normal cells multiply themselves to form new cells according to needs of body, grow in a healthy way and die when they grow old or are damaged. In some occasions this order disrupts and damaged/abnormal cells multiply instead of dying. Tumours named as graft aggregates occur. Tumours can be benign or malign. <br><br>
							Benign tumours do not intend to spread into the nearby grafts. They usually do not relapse when they are taken out but some of them in brain may cause symptoms which threaten life.

						<h3>How Does Cancer Come Into Existence?</h3>
						<div class="mt-0 mt-lg-4"></div>
						<p>Firstly we need to understand the genetic alterations which cause cancer. Proto-oncogenes, tumour suppressor genes and DNA repairing genes which are affected during the process of cancer cause some changes in body. Oncogenes are namely the disordered genes which take part in modifying a normal cell into a cancer cell and formation of abnormal proteins. Proto-oncogenes take an active part in normal cell growth and division. But if they are more active than normal or subjected to structural changes, oncogene (the gene which causes cancer) can be formed. In this case, an uncontrollable multiplying of cells is in question. Tumour supressing genes are on duty for cell growth and multiplying. Potential changes which may occur in these genes cause uncontrollable cell divisions. DNA repairing genes are responsible for the fixation of the damaged DNA and the mutations occur in these genes, changes like copying and deleting of chromosome pieces form a basis for the formation of cancer cells. The more the scientific works present data on the genetic alterations, the more it has been seen that some mutations commonly take place in many cancer types. Many options of treatments which target the gene mutations which cause cancer are available in 21th century. Nearly all of them are practiced on patients professionally by our Turkish physicians and cancer has been taken under control. </p>
						<div class="mt-3 mt-lg-6"></div>
						<h3>How Does Cancer Spread? Can the Cancer which Metastasize be Treated?</h3>
						<div class="mt-0 mt-lg-4"></div>
						<p>The cancers which spread another tissue than the place they formed are called metastatic cancer. The term metastasis states the process of spread of the cancer cells to other areas of body. Metastatic cancer has the same type of cells with the initially formed cancer. That is to say, the breast cancer which spreads to lungs is not lung cancer but a breast cancer which metastasized. When metastatic cancer cells are looked in a microscope, it is frequently seen that they have the same type and name with the original or initial cancer type. Besides, metastatic cancer cells and original ones host the common molecular characteristics which have specific chromosome alterations. <br><br>
							During metastatic cancer treatments, physicians strive to extend lives of cancer patients, and practice the treatment methods to raise the existing living standards. The main aim is to control the growth of cancer initially. Besides this, relieving the symptoms also rise the living standards of patient radically.

						<h3>What are the Types of Cancer?</h3>
						<p>There are more than a hundred types of cancer overall the world. Cancer types are generally named according to the organs or tissues in which they have formed. Lung cancer starts in lungs, brain cancer starts in brain. Besides they may also be defined according to cell type which forms cancer like epithelial cell, squamous cell and a like. <br><br>
							Cancer types which start in a definite cell type are as follows:

									<div id="faqItem1" class="collapse show faq-item-content" role="tabpanel">
										<div>
											<p>Carcinomas are the most frequently seen cancer types. They are formed by the epithelial cells which cover inside-outside of body. When they are looked by a microscope, they are frequently in pillar-like shape and there are a lot of epithelial cells. Carcinomas take some names according to the variety of epithelial cells. Adenocarcinoma occurs in epithelial cells which excrete mucus. In this type, epithelial cells are mostly found in glandular tissues. Most of the prostate, breast and colon cancers are adenocarcinomas. Carcinoma with basal cell is a cancer type which starts in the substratum of epidermis which is the outer layer of skin. Carcinoma with squamous cells is the cancer type which occurs in squamous cells right under epidermis. Squamous cell types also cover many organs like intestines, stomach, kidneys, bladder and lungs. Squamous cell carcinoma which is seen like fish scales under microscope is sometimes called epidermoid carcinoma. Carcinoma with transitional cells is a cancer type which forms in epithelium tissue named as urothelium or transition epithelium. This tissue which may grow and shrink and occur in many epithelium layers takes place in kidneys (especially in kidney pelvis), bladder, ureters and outer parts of some organs. </p>

However, many abnormal white blood cells accumulate in bone marrows and blood (leukemic blast cells). These leave normal blood cells outside. The normal blood cells which remain in low levels complicate the passing of oxygen to the tissues of body, controlling bleedings and fight against infections. It is grouped according to the progression of the illness and type of the blood cells in which the cancer has started. Acute leukaemia forms are growing more rapidly while chronic forms are growing more slowly.</p>

						<h3>How is Cancer Diagnosed?</h3>
						<div class="mt-0 mt-lg-4"></div>
						<p>Diagnosing cancer in early stages generally provides the best chance for treatment. </p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-6">
								<ul>
									<li> <b> Physical Examination: </b> During the examination, your doctor may feel the bumps which can be signs of cancer. There can also be seen anomalies to indicate the presence of cancer like changes on skin colour or growth of an organ. </li>
									<li> <b> Laboratory Tests: </b> : Laboratory investigations like urinary and blood tests may be guiding for doctor to understand the reasons of cancer. For example, a common blood test named as complete blood cell count may reveal white blood cells in an extraordinary amount or type in leukaemia patients. </li>
								</ul>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-6">
								<ul>
									<li> <b> Scanning Tests: </b> Scanning tests enable your doctor to examine your bones and visceral organs. Ways of scanning which are used in diagnosis of cancer are: Computer tomography (CT), Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET-CT) scanning, ultrasound and X-ray</li>
									<li> <b> Biyopsi: </b> In biopsy, our doctor collects a cell sample for laboratory test. There are a couple of ways to collect samples. Suitability of a biopsy procedure depends on your cancer type and its location. In many situations the only way to diagnose cancer is biopsy.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>Doctors examine the cell samples in microscope. Normal cells seem in a single type, with similar dimensions and a regular organization. Cancer cells reveal less in regularity without an explicit organization and in changing dimensions.</p>
						<div class="mt-3 mt-lg-6"></div>
						<h3>Stages of Cancer</h3>
						<div class="mt-0 mt-lg-4"></div>
						<p>After diagnosing cancer, your doctor will be focused on determining the scope (stage) of your cancer because stage of cancer is really important while planning treatment. While doing staging, bone scanning or X rays may be used to see whether cancer has spread on the other parts of body. Cancer stages are generally revealed with Roman numerals from 0 to IV (from 0 to 4). Higher numbers reveal a higher stage. Cancer stage is stated by letters or words in some types of cancer. </p>
						<div class="mt-3 mt-lg-6"></div>
						<h3>What are the Symptoms of Cancer?</h3>
						<div class="mt-0 mt-lg-4"></div>
						<p>Symptoms which are the causes of cancer depend on body parts which are affected. Symptoms which are related with cancer but not specific to it are: </p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="col-md-6">
								<ul>
									<li>Tiredness</li>
									<li>Palpable mass under skin which is noticed by patient of physician during physical examination </li>
									<li>Unwanted weight changes (Weight gaining, weight loss)</li>
									<li>Changes on skin like yellowing, darkening or redness</li>
									<li>Non healing wounds or changes on existing nevuses</li>
									<li>Change in intestines or urinary bladder</li>




								</ul>

									<li>Fevers or night swelters which cannot be explained</li>
									<li>Bleeding or empurpling which cannot be explained</li>
								</ul>
							</div>
						</div>
						<p>If you have none of the symptoms stated above but have concerns about cancer risk, you need to consult your doctor and make an appointment to plan your scanning tests with physical examination.</p>

						<div class="mt-3"></div>
						<h3>How is the Treatment of Cancer?</h3>
						<p>Treatment of cancer is to use surgery, radiation, drugs and other treatment methods to treat, minimize or stop the spread of cancer. There are many treatment plans to be applied in Turkey according to your private situation. Aim of cancer treatment is to find a solution to your cancer and enable you to lead a normal life. If no treatment is possible, your treatments may be used to enable you to live without symptoms as long as possible and decelerate growth of cancer. <br><br>
