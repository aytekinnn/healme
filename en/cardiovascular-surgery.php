                        <p>The heart whose duty is to pump the arterial blood into the tissues of our body works in coordination with the venous blood vessel system which collects the venous blood from tissues and brings it back to heart. Department of cardiovascular surgery is the branch that applies early diagnosis and treatment in the problems of heart and the vascular system which heart works together. <br><br>
                            Cardiovascular diseases are the most frequently encountered reason of death in our country. With the continuous development of modern medicine in Turkey, early diagnosis provides a significant amount of benefit for treatment of diseases. Necessary surgical applications for treatment are executed by cardiovascular specialists who are well equipped. <br><br>
                            The complaints which are considered to be connected with hearth and vessels in medical applications are: <br>

                                            <p>Coronary arteries are the arterial blood vessels which are surrounding heart and responsible for its nourishment. Just as the functional tissues in our body need arterial blood from heart to perform their duties, heart needs arterial blood to perform its duty as well and this needed arterial blood is presented by the coronary arteries. If any stenosis or blockage occurs in these arteries, cardiac muscles cannot get enough blood and their function will be deteriorated. As a result of this, the probability of myocardial infarction (heart attack), congestive heart failure or sudden death will increase. <br><br>
                                                By-pass means bridging. By pass is applied to the blocked coronary arteries by the grafts of vessels which will not cause a functional loss when they are taken (frequently left internal mammary artery and fore arm artery). It is a process to transmit the blood which could not pass from the blocked coronary artery to heart via the newly placed artery. <br><br>
                                                Coronary by-pass operation may be applied by stopping the heart or on a beating heart. The method is preferred according to the place and size of the blocked vessel and the other system diseases of patient (respiratory or kidney). <br><br>
                                                Bypass and the frequently applied open heart surgery in the pass have started to be replaced with minimal invasive surgery with the developed technology of today. In minimal invasive surgery, bypass process is executed by reaching heart from armpit with a small cut and without cutting chest of patient. <br><br>
                                                After our experienced surgeons’ using robotic systems in by-pass surgery in recent years, significant progresses have been observed by this method’s enhancing patient comfort and operation success by diminishing the recovery period of patient.

                                            <p>Aneurysm is swelling of the vessel like a balloon as a result of the vein wall weakening and loss of flexibility. Aorta is the main artery that distributes the blood which came from the left heart to body. <br><br>
                                                Aneurysms generally happen in the abdominal area, and they may not give any alerts until they grow discreetly for years and explode. An exploded abdominal aortic aneurysm causes severe pain in back and abdomen, swelter on skin, dizziness, internal haemorrhaging and shock. It necessitates urgent treatment. <br><br>
                                                Small aneurysms are routinely monitored and do not necessitate surgical treatment, but surgery is recommended if they are big or have a risk of exploding. <br><br>
                                                Two main methods may be used in aneurysm surgery as endovascular (closed) method and open surgery.

                                            <p> Heart transplant is an operation of transplant when the other treatment methods do not suffice in the persons who have advanced stage heart failure and coronary diseases. The aim is to plant the heart of a donor whose brain deaths are recognized into the patient. <br><br>
                                                Heart transplantations have been executed with success in Turkey but we are not able to perform the transplantation for our foreign patients, because the organs taken from Turkish donors whose brain deaths are recognized can only be transplanted to Turkish citizens according to the Laws of Turkish Republic.
