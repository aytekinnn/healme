                        <p>Turkish brain surgery experts are interested in vascular system, spinal cord, central and peripheral nerves, brain and vessels which are located in brain. They use developed techniques and technologies to evaluate and treat neurotic defects by executing collaborative works with neurology experts. Diseases and operations on which brain surgery experts are interested and treat professionally are mainly:

                                            <p>Brain surgery experts practice brain tumour operations by using some methods like high definition MR (magnetic resonance), CAT scan and functional screening and their highly advanced experiences in the diagnosis of brain tumours. Low risk and complication levels bring happy results with the help of Da Vinci robotic surgery and sensitive micro surgery instruments. Thanks to the advanced technology, brain surgeon continues the operation after distinguishing the special tissue from normal one by colouring it with special tissue colours. Furthermore, intensive care, patient care services and neuro anaesthetic approach are provided on high standards to ensure that patient is able to continue their vital functions before, during and after the operation and obtain higher living standards. Examples of neuro oncology area operations are as follows:

                                                • Tumours which metastasize to brain or resulted from brain’s own structure <br>
                                                • Schwannoma and meningioma<br>
                                                • Hypophysis tumours <br>
                                                • Brain stem and cerebellar neoplasms <br>
                                                • Intraventricular and skull neoplasms are solved with successful brain surgery operations. <br>

                                            <p>Successful brain surgeons, neurologists, diagnostic and interventional radiologists and expert teams in intensive care area provide a highly specialized treatment on all the turns of cerebrovascular disease. In some cases these conditions are ensured with micro surgery which contains craniotomy, that is, opening the skull and a brain surgeon’s using highly specialized microscope and surgical tools to define the vessels and take the disease under control. Besides this, endovascular brain surgery area which does not necessitate opening of skull has been also possible with usage of developed technologies recently. The brain surgeons who work in coordination with interventional radiologists make a small cut from femoral artery in legs or biracial artery in arms and put microcatheter to this area. Then the brain is reached by the purpose of reaching vascular malformation. Endovascular techniques make the areas of brain reachable which were not reachable in the past. In this way, brain surgeons treat the most dangerous parts of the brain to be reached. Endovascular surgery is a procedure in which minimal invasive techniques are used in the situations like aneurism which means swelling or bubbling of blood vessel. Patient feels less pain in comparison to the conventional open surgery and duration of staying at hospital is shorter. Therefore complication risk is in more minimal levels. Endovascular surgery involves spiral stenting, angioplasty and embolization. <br><br>
                                                Neurovascular disease treatments happen in a short time with radiosurgery. It is a kind of operation which is done by using radiation. Gama knife is a method in which the surgeon treats brain disorders without needing to make cuts. Gama knife is accepted as an effective and highly reliable treatment method.

Surgical treatment option is considered especially in herniation which occurs in spinal cord, spinal stenosis, that is, the narrowness of the canals in spinal cord, traumas, spinal cord eluxation, spinal cord tumours or (congenital) structural disorders of the spine by birth. Herniated disc, cervical disc hernia, waist eluxation, spinal cord canal narrowing, Chiari malformation, kyphoplasty and scoliosis operations are done with high success levels in our country.</p>

                                            <p>Working of body is different in infants and child patients in comparison to adults. This necessitates different approaches in brain surgery as well. Using surgical equipment which has been specially designed for every age group, paediatric surgery experts have been doing all brain and nerve operations between infantry-age 18. Successful results are being taken on the treatment of following diseases: <br><br>
                                                • Paediatric spinal diseases <br>
                                                • Malformations in skull (craniostosis) <br>
                                                • Spina bifida <br>

                        <h4>Epilepsy Surgeries</h4>
                        <p>Epilepsy is widely seen both in our country and around the world. Patients get medical treatment from neurology clinics before coming to surgical stage. If episode scannot be controlled with medicine, then epilepsy surgery is needed to take the problematic area which causes the episodes. Surgeon recommends patient to get an operation in following conditions: <br><br>
                            • Physical wounds caused by episodes <br>
                            • Suffocation risk if the episode occurs during bath or swimming <br>
                            • Depression and anxiety <br>
                            • Developmental delays in children caused by epilepsy <br>
                            • Risk of death if patient does not have an operation <br>
                            • Weakening of memory and cognitive functions day by day <br><br>

                            Brain surgery experts are mostly using resective surgery method in epilepsy. With this method, a small part of brain is taken out. Resective surgery is most frequently performed on one of the temporal lobes which control memory, feelings and understanding the language. <br><br>
                            In laser interstitial thermal therapy method, surgeon tries to annihilate a small part of brain which causes epilepsy with laser. In laser interstitial thermal therapy method which is a minimal invasive operation method, magnetic resonance imaging (MR) is used for the purpose of directing laser rays. <br><br>
                            In deep brain simulation, a device which is implanted into a deep area of brain to free regular electric signals which trigger episode and disrupt activity is used. Again magnetic resonance imaging is benefited from. And the generator which sends electric simulations is implanted into chest. <br><br>
                            Corpus celotomy means taking out all or part of the corpus callosum area which ties right and left hemispheres of the brain. This method is generally preferred in children who have various diseases as a result of abnormal brain activities spreading from a side to another side of the brain. Besides, hemispherectomy and functional hemispherectomy operations are practiced as well.

                        </p>

                        <h4>Parkinson Disease Operations</h4>
                        <p>Disorders which are caused by Parkinson disease can be prevented by placing millimetric electronic sticks, a small power supply and an extension lead which unites these two in brain. After the operation, the person is monitored and adjustment of electrodes is made. This battery can be controlled with a remote controller by the patient and doctor and its adjustments can be changed. This enabling of control is so important to detect the value which is the most efficient. <br><br>

                            <b> Does the Battery have a Physical Life?</b> <br>
                            Physical life of battery can range from 3 up to 6 years according to the situation of patient and region of brain where it has been applied. When the battery dies, it is enough to change it by an operation under skin in chest without needing an extra operation. <br><br>

                            <b> Do the indications of disease disappear completely after the operation?</b> <br>
                            After the operation of brain battery, trembling, slow movement and the side effects which drug treatment causes and decrease the living quality of patient diminish in a considerable level. Daily activities like tying shoes, buttoning shirts up, drinking water can be met personally.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Herniated Disc Surgeries</h4>
                        <p>Herniated disc is among the diseases which are experienced by one of every four after a certain age. Compression of spinal cord nerve root in waist generally causes pain. Not only herniation of the disc, but also narrowness of spinal cord causes pain. These pains are generally called as radiculopathy or sciatica pains. This is among the most frequent operations which are done in the area of brain surgery. <br><br>
                            In herniated disc surgeries, surgeon takes a small part of the bone on nerve root or the disc under nerve root to eliminate nerve compression or enable the nerve to heal. The most common operation types are microdiscectomy and laminectomy. Also with lumbar fusion method, cease of herniated disc pain in a painful movement segment under the low back is aimed. <br><br>
                            With developing of robotic surgery method in recent years, brain surgery experts have been used microscopic discectomy method to treat herniated disc disease. Happy results are obtained without opening large cuts in patient and diminishing the period of hospitalization by the aim of eliminating lumbar hernia. Patient can be dismissed the day after.
