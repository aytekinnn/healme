                        <h4>What Is a Stem Cell?</h4>
                        <p>Stem cells are the cells which can transform into all cells in the body and they have the quality of renewing themselves. They are the main building blocks of every organ and tissue in our body. When a stem cell is divided, if can be left as a copy of itself for transform into a different cell like muscle or red blood which are functional in the body. <br><br>
                            Our body contains stem cells in every period of our lives and uses them when necessary. Stem cells enable tissue recovery and formations of new tissues in case of the damages happened by reason of illness, wounding and other reasons. Stem cells have two main sources: Adult body tissues and embryonic tissues. Embryonic stem cells are the stem cells which enable tissue and organ formation and they can be differentiated into all cells. They can be stored in stem cell banks by being taken from the navel cord and amniotic fluid, and can be a source of stem cell for patients. <br><br>
                            The adult stem cells which are mainly used in the stem cell therapy are the stem cells which take place in the differentiated tissues of the body, but they have not completed the differentiation period yet. When compared to embryonic stem cells, they have more limited capabilities of differentiation. The adult stem cells mostly form the tissue they are in (like bone marrow, nerve and muscle tissue). <br><br>
                            Previously it was believed that the stem cells which take place in bone marrow could only produce blood cells but the proofs which were shown up by the latest studies reveal that various cell types (heart muscle, forex) could be formed with bone marrow stem cells.

                        <h4>What Can Be Done By Stem Cells? Where Are They Used?</h4>
                        <ul class="numbered-list-lg">
                            <li>They help to understand how diseases occur. Investigative doctors can have detailed information about formation of diseases by ripening stem cells like a cell of organ tissues by the help of an external stimulus and watching this ripening period (especially cancer and genetic diseases) </li>
                            <li>Stem cells for treatment purposes can be placed instead of the damaged tissues and the tissue is enabled in this way.</li>
                            <li>Steam cells can be used to observe the side effects of drugs and test the reliability and quality of them in human body. </li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Stem Cell Treatment</h4>
                        <p>Stem cell treatment is a treatment method which is known as bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow transplant is the most frequently used stem cell treatment today, but stem cell transplant is not limited with bone marrow transplant.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Bone Marrow Transplant</h4>
                        <p>Bone marrow transplant is made in leukaemia cases which do not respond chemotherapy, many cancers which renew themselves (by repeating) and diseases like aplastic anaemia in which the patients cannot produce their own blood cells. <br><br>
                            The stem cell therapy which is known as regenerative medicine is the process of taking healthy stem cells from a healthy donor and transferring it to patient (allogeneic transplant) or collecting the healthy cells from the person before the disease and transferring them to the patient during treatment (otology transplant). Stem cells can be obtained from bone marrows, circulating blood and navel string. They are multiplied in laboratory during treatment and stimulated into the different cell types like heart muscle, nerve or blood cells. The new specialised cells which have been obtained are injected into the damaged cells via vessels or directly. Transplant cannot always provide the desired results and stem cell treatment may be repeated in this case.
