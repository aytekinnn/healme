                        <p>Genes are the main building blocks of genetics. They contain the qualities which are transferred from parents. Gene structure forms chromosome and chromosomes form DNA. <br><br>
                            Genetic structure and environment where a person lives have impacts on a person’s health, behaviour and abilities. A person who was born healthy with respect to their genetic structure may be subjected to genetic mutation because of the reasons like negative environmental factors, low socioeconomic levels and deteriorations may be seen in the genes which this person will transfer to the new generations. Also the new individuals whom the defect genes were transferred may experience the related diseases in every period of their lives. <br><br>
                            Genetic diseases may cause very serious health problems and their treatment is limited. A family member’s getting a genetic disease diagnosis forms a risk for other family members, too.

                        <p>Genetic consultancy is the service which diagnoses the diseases caused by genetic reasons or genetic susceptibility, plans treatment, monitor the patients and their families, forms family tree and evaluates next generations with respect to risk of illness and apply society screening programs.</p>

                        <h4>Genetic Researches in Turkey</h4>
                        <p>Our country became a developed country in genetics as a result of successful studies and researches in the areas of gene and biotechnology. At least 10 genes have been found by Turkish scientists in recent years. <br><br>
                            Quite beneficial developments which respect to the apprehension of human genomes are observed with the developed universities and clinics which provide high level service.
