                                            <p>Their field of study spreads onto a larger area in comparison to other medical expertises.

Control of doping, which is accepted as unethical in sports, is also under the responsibility of sports physicians. They take precautionary measurements against disabilities which can happen during game and stand ready with health care staff for the physical injuries and trauma on the edge of the field. They aim to bring the athlete who got distanced to trainings and games back to sports. <br><br>
                                                Sport physicians may send the player back into the match within seconds after the injury, but injuries may not be this light all the time. This process may last for months according to the size, severity or area of the injury and if any permanent injury occurs, the athlete may not be able to return sports. In this case, ensuring the rehabilitation is also among the duties of sports physicians. <br><br>
                                                Sport physicians use exercise as a prescription. They examine importance of physical activity with regard of health. They regulate the exercises physical activities of patients who have consulted with common chronical disease like obesity, diabetes, asthma, or hypertension, prepare a suitable prescription exercise for the patients and track them regularly. They also evaluate the effects of exercise on the health of patients.
